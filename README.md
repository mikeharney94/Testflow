# Testflow - Configurable Test creation software
**Please view the demo.mp4 file***
The purpose of this project is to create a web application that allows teachers to create Tests that can be easily configured, built, taken, and graded.

The heart of this application is the Question Builder, which allows teachers to create test with a variety of draggable components. The Client and Server sides are written so that anything can be used as part of a Test if three simple functions are written.

1) Add an empty field to the Question page
2) Convert an existing field to a 'Component' item
3) Convert a 'Component' item into a field

This allows for a Test building application that scales as far as your imagination and skills with HTML

The program also deals with User Management, and creating Classes of students. In the future, this application will also be able to take, and grade tests
